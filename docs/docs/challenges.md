# Challenges Faced & Solutions

## Overview

Building this project involved various challenges, particularly around API integration, state management, and dynamic data handling. Below are the key challenges faced and the solutions implemented to overcome them.

## Challenge 1: API Rate Limits

### Solution:

To handle API rate limits imposed by the CoinGecko API, React Query's caching mechanism was utilized. By caching data and setting appropriate stale times, the number of requests sent to the API was minimized, effectively reducing the likelihood of hitting the rate limit.

## Challenge 2: Managing Stale Data

### Solution:

React Query's configuration allows for specific stale and cache times, which were set based on the expected data volatility (cryptocurrency prices). This setup ensures that the data users see is not only up-to-date but also reduces unnecessary data fetching, improving the application's performance.

## Challenge 3: Error Handling

### Solution:

Comprehensive error handling was implemented within the API fetching function (`fetchCryptos`) and the UI component. By catching errors and displaying user-friendly messages, the application ensures a smooth user experience even when unexpected issues occur.

## Conclusion

The challenges faced during the development of this project were significant learning opportunities. The solutions implemented enhanced the application's reliability, performance, and user experience.
